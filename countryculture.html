        <h1>The Estonian culture</h1>
        <img src="ct.png"width="300" height="180">
        <div id="facts">
        <p>The culture of Estonia combines an indigenous heritage, represented by the country's 
        Finnic national language Estonian, with Nordic and German cultural aspects.</p>
        
        <p>The importance of song and choral music to the cultural life of Estonia 
        has led to an abundance of choral music and choirs with varied voicings and purpose.
         From casual singing at the beginning of a town meeting to the use of song as a means for revolt
          against the former Soviet regime, choral singing has long been a part of Baltic culture</p>

        <p>Estonia's historical national clothes resemble those of many European regions in their basic form;
         linen shirts,woollen skirts for women, trousers for men, knit socks, embroidered accessories and beads.</p>

         <p>The food culture in Estonia is typically linked to the various seasons of the year and the staples 
        of the country, such as rye bread, meat and fish as well as potatoes and roots.</p>
